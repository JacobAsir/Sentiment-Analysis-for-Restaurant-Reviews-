# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Restaurant-Reviews-
Built a Sentiment Analysis Model for Restaurant Reviews 👍👎🍽️

I'm thrilled to share that I've built a machine learning model for analyzing sentiment in restaurant reviews! This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine whether reviews are positive or negative. 

🔍 Project Overview: 

➖I developed this model to analyze and categorize the sentiments expressed in restaurant reviews. Here's a breakdown of the steps I followed:

➖Imported Necessary Libraries: Leveraged powerful libraries essential for data manipulation and NLP tasks.

➖Data Understanding and Preprocessing:
Cleaned the reviews by removing special characters.
Converted all text to lowercase for uniformity.
Tokenized the reviews into individual words.
Removed stop words to focus on significant terms.
Applied stemming and lemmatization for word normalization.
Compiled a comprehensive corpus of cleaned reviews.

➖Feature Extraction:
Created a Bag of Words model to represent the text data numerically.

➖Model Building:
Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier.
Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.

➖Evaluation:
Assessed the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix metrics.

➖Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tuned the Naive Bayes model to enhance its predictive accuracy.

➖Predictions:
Applied the optimized model to new data for sentiment prediction.

I'm passionate about leveraging data to derive meaningful insights and enhance decision-making processes. This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I look forward to exploring more in the field of NLP and machine learning!
